        <p class="lead mb-4">Education History: In my earlier years in education, I graduated from Glendale High School. I received the Silver Award for aceiving a 3.9 GPA. From here I took my talents to the University of California-Riverside. Based in the city of Riverside, this is where I prospered and obtained all the skills I have. Being a full time student from the start of my freshman year and holding down a job made me withold the importance of time management and hard work. At the beginnning of university, I took classes more related to the topic of technoloyg. Passing classes such as Computer Science, Coding, and Enginerring. I was able to grasp the basics and more of the technoloyg we use today. From there my journey took me to business related courses such as Business Administration, Accounting, and Marketing. These courses granted me the knowledge of how the world of business truly works. Whether the assignment includes understanding how a business model is made or how to reach a higher promotion, I am sophisticated enough to get the job done. Aside from the academics, throughout my four years at UC Riverside, I implemented various extracurriculars alongside my education. To name a few, boxing club, basketball intramural, and accouting internship. At the end I graduaated with a degree in Marketing, which is where I see my future being revolved by. Alongside my degree, I gradutated with a 4.0 GPA cements me in the world of business.  <br><br>

        My Origination: I am a Latino/Chicano. I was born and raised in Glendale, Los Angeles. I attended Horace Mann Elementary, Theodore Roosevelt Middle School, and Glandale High School. My parents are both from Oaxaca, Mexico. Also, growing up the eldest sibling out of 4 siblings. I took the job as a role model and to lead my little brothers down a better path than mine. Growing up in a low-middle class family, taught me how to handle and think about currency in a different light. This made me invest not only money, but time and other resources into investments. 
        <br><br>

        Current Proffesional Experience: I am currently employed at a local Accounting Firm in Downey, California. For it being close to home, I feel much more comfortable and I will be able to perform at my peak everyday. I have been employed at this Accounting Firm for sixth months now, headed towards my seventh. With the marketing degree I graduated with, as said earlier, I am able to manage how our team is able to put our name out in the world. Promote our ethical and productive practices done here at Downey. Also understanding other aspects of the buinesss world, I am gaining knowledge on how it is to be in charge of other stations at the firm. I plan on being employed at Downey for at least another year. Then I will begin to carry out my other plans such as starting my own clothing brand. But staying employed at a well established business will gain me more knowledge every day and will promote my business skills to flourish in the real world.
